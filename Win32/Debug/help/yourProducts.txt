The Your Products Screen:

This screen shows your entire catalogue of items. You can also see how many items you are selling in total.
To browse your catalogue, use the scrollbar.

At first, you are only shown at most ten items. To view more of your catalogue, click the "load more items" button.

For each item, you are shown its name, image as well as the total sales and revenue you got from it.
To view more of the item's details and to edit them, click on the "view item" buttons.

If you want to create a new item, click the "Add item" button to take you to the add item screen.

To remove an item from your catalogue, click on the red cross to the right of the item. Please note that
this doesn't remove the item sales from the database but only makes it unavailable for further purchase and editing.
